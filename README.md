# Curriculum-Vitae
The latest version of my CV (with matching cover letter), powered by LaTeX and TikZ.

## Style
This CV + cover letter template is designed to be minimalistic and professional (depending on a colorscheme of b&w with only one additional colour), while still showing off LaTeX and TikZ skills.

Furthermore, the template is extremely customisable, and heavily commented in the preamble to facilitate this.

## Building
To build the .pdf files, simply run
    
    $ pdflatex "Petar Veličković - Curriculum Vitae.tex"

    $ pdflatex "Petar Veličković - Cover Letter.tex"
  
## Sample output
The latest compiled version of my CV as seen in this repository will always be stored at [my personal github.io blog](http://petarv-.github.io/PetarV-CurriculumVitae.pdf).
